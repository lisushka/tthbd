# This Talk Has Been Disabled - DDD Perth 2022 - Transcript

HANNAH: Going to kick us off today is Dawn, Dawn E. Collett.  Dawn likes to tinker with cloud infrastructure and security, and regularly goes down rabbit holes in a futile search- a futile search for ways to develop systems that are both reliable and impenetrable.  As well as accidental accessibility advocacy, Dawn can regularly be found sharing knowledge within the Melbourne cloud infrastructure and DevOps communities.  Outside work, Dawn is an occasional author, a kitchen alchemist, and a raging sportsball fan.  Over to you, Dawn!

DAWN: Thank you!  Can everyone hear me; am I hooked up to the AV?  [pause]

So, I was supposed to come here today to talk to you about web accessibility.  But unfortunately, on my flight from Melbourne to Perth yesterday, my talk was disabled; so I'm going to spend approximately the next 45 minutes explaining to you how we go about re-enabling it.  If you want to follow along with the sources that I used when I was putting together this talk, you can scan that QR code up there, or go to the Github link.  That will take you to a Github repository which has all of the sources sorted by type.

To begin with, I want to acknowledge the fact that I am presenting today on Aboriginal land.  I want to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land here, the Whadjuk Nyungar people; and also the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation, on whose land this talk came into being.  This country is and always will be Aboriginal land.  Their sovereignty was never ceded.  I also want to tip my hat to- the old men and women, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mentors that I myself had growing up.  Because among many other incredibly valuable lessons that I learned from them, they taught me about the importance of stories, and I wouldn't be here giving this presentation to you today without them.

I also want to thank all of the sponsors who have made this possible.  It has been amazing to be able to come from Melbourne to Perth to do this, already to meet so many awesome people; and it would not be possible without all of the sponsors.

You've kind of got the introduction there.  That's me; my name is Dawn; my day job is I'm an engineer at Innablr - we are a tiny little consultancy in Melbourne, we love solving DevOps and cloudy type problems - that's what I do in my day job, if you want to know more about that you can ask me more.  But the reason that I'm here speaking to all of you today is because I am an accidental accessibility advocate.  We're going to get back to that one.  As Hannah said, outside work I am an occasional author and kitchen alchemist - sometimes that ends really well, sometimes it doesn't.  I am also a raging sportsball fan, hence that picture and this being me in Boston Bruins clothing.  That's a hockey team, for the record.

So, the accidental accessibility advocate bit.  The last two words of that are very easy to understand.  The accidental is a bit less so.  And in order to explain that, I need to take you on a little bit of a tour.  And we are going to start that tour in the UK, with this excellent disabled toilet which is down a set of stairs.  I don't know if any of you have ever tried to take a wheelchair down a set of stairs; do not recommend.  Over in New Zealand, much closer to home, we do actually have a ramp to be able to get into this building, but unfortunately for the poor powerchair user who's currently sitting and staring at it, it is blocked off by a couple of large orange traffic cones.  Again - if you want to get into the building, not absolutely conducive to that.

And finally, the place where I conceived this talk, and the place where I live - in Melbourne - we have these EXELOOs around the place.  Erm, space age public toilets, if you will.  And the reason why these made it into a talk about accidental accessibility advocacy, is because they have a cleaning cycle which runs.  And that is indicated by a large light which will go on in the cubicle of the toilet.  There is also a panel in the toilet which explains that when the large light goes on, you should vacate, because it's about to start its cleaning cycle.  That panel is translated into Braille.  Braille.  Blind people.  Light.  Doesn't quite compute there.

So before I get on, let's define a few important terms.  To begin with: disability, by the Australian definition, is a continuing condition which restricts everyday activities.  A continuing condition means that it's likely to last for six months or more; the restricting everyday activities bit is fairly self-explanatory.  Then there's accessibility, and that's the degree to which an activity can be done by everyone.  Now, this is not just about disability.  One s- case study that I like to use here is from about December 2009, if anyone remembers HP's racist webcam, where a black gentleman had gone out and bought himself a state-of-the-art HP laptop which had a wonderful web camera which was supposed to be able to do facial recognition.  Except it couldn't.  Until he got his white co-worker to test it.

And then there's adaptive technology.  And those are tools that disabled people to- use to improve access.  That can be exceptionally low-tech.  This - my walking stick - is a piece of adaptive technology.  Wheelchairs are adaptive technology.  Some things that we use in architecture, like ramps, can be part of adaptive technology.  But in the broader sense, in terms of technical pieces of adaptive technology, we're talking here about things like screen readers; things like adaptive and augmentative communication; things which are essentially attached to a computer.

And - warning - this is where we get political for a minute.  Excuse me- as I get back to the right slide.  There are, broadly, two different ways that we can define disability: the medical model and the social model.  The medical model of disability holds that disability itself is a problem; that disability is something that we should try to resolve, something that we should try to cure.  And that is illustrated here by this clipart blob in a wheelchair being comforted by a vaguely doctor-looking clipart blob.  On the other hand the social model holds that it's not so much disability that's the problem, it's accessibility; that we shouldn't be trying to change people, we should be trying to change the world around them to make it easier to navigate.  And when that goes well, that's illustrated by things like adaptive sports that we have over here.  You know, these people who are playing sports in wheelchairs look perfectly happy doing it.  And I wouldn't want to dismiss the medical model entirely because there are some great interventions that have come out of that.  But for the purposes of the work that we're doing, the way that I would suggest that we look at this is through the lens of the social model.  We want to try to modify the environment to make it easier for people to use.

And, if you're here, I feel pretty confident in saying that this is part of your job!  So to illustrate that, let's look at a few case studies of how this goes well and how this goes badly.  This is `arngren.net`, and I didn't have to look very hard to find this; it's on a great many list of top 10 worst websites ever.  And it's visually very cluttered.  You can see that - I mean it would probably make more sense to me if I spoke Norwegian - but you've got a bunch of pictures here which are all very confused, you've got a bunch of colours, there's not really a whole lot of structure to it.  And it would not surprise you that if you try to navigate `arngren.net` with a screen reader, you're going to have a great deal of difficulty doing it.  Because that structure that's replicated- that structure that we see here visually is replicated in the lack of structure that you get when trying to navigate it with a screen reader.  There's a hell of a lot of red and green here, and that's really difficult for colourblind people.  Unsurprisingly, many of the images here don't actually have alt text, and it's also not clear which images are tied to which links because of the lack of structure.

And then there's distinctive design.  This is Ling's Cars, and you may or may not believe this, but this is actually one of the most successful car leasing businesses in the United Kingdom.  And it is built around the brand of Ling Valentine, the owner.  And the brand is obvious.  Ling's face is animated.  The, ah, tongue with the British flag on it is animated.  The traffic lights are animated.  And my favourite bit, which I couldn't get into this screenshot from when I originally took it, was the GIF of Boris Johnson shrugging used to illustrate the Boris Brexit Guarantee: that if the UK left the EU, the cost of leasing your car would not go up.

But if you want to build a distinctive website like this, there are a lot of considerations that go into it.  You have to think about things like - that text across the top, that's not text, that's actually clipart.  So it's not necessarily going to be immediately apparent that that's the launching point of your page, and you also need to then add alt text to it.  You can have issues with backgrounds making it difficult for people to navigate things.  You know, there is a lot of alt text that has gone into this website, but when I originally looked at it, there wasn't a lot of it there.  There were a lot of scenarios where pictures were used to illustrate things without something that would be backed up by a screen reader.  And if you have photos- photosensitivity problems, you are not going to have fun trying to navigate the site.

Then there's an example of good design.  And this is one that probably a lot of us use every day, and that is Github.  Github does a few things really well that are not necessarily intuitive.  To start with, if you look at that top bar over there, you can see that you've got the Github logo; the search bar; but then next to it, you've actually got `Pull Requests`, `Issues`, `Marketplace`, `Explore`.  And those are easy anchors for screen reader users to be able to get to the areas of Github that they might frequently use.  Github is very, very good about not just conveying information with colour.  The layout is quite easy to understand visually.  It scales very well.  And this is actually a screenshot of the NVDA repo - the free and open-source screen reader for Windows.  And the people who developed NVDA migrated it over to Github because they found that for their users - the vast majority of whom are screen reader users - GitHub was a very easy way for them to submit bugs.


If you want to do this well, there are a bunch of resources for it.  The Web Content Accessibility Guides are sort of the canonical resource, but if you find those too difficult, or if you're doing this for the first time and you want something that's a bit easier to understand, the Accessibility Project has produced a checklist where you can just go down the checklist and it conveys it all to you in a much simpler manner.  And you can pretty much just tick boxes to work out 'do you actually follow the guidelines?'  One thing that I don't talk very much about in this talk is designing for intellectual and cognitive disabilities, but the main resource that you're going to want for that is the US Federal Plain Language Guidelines.  These are published by the US government, and they provide you instructions on how to use plain, clear English, which is going to be easier for people with intellectual and cognitive disabilities to understand.  And there's a blind lady called Kristy Viers who produced a video which went viral on Twitter, showing how she uses her iPhone.  And this, I think, is a really important thing for people to see.  Not because- well, because it shows you what's possible when you think outside the box, and when you design these things taking into account a wide variety of different perspectives.  The iPhone has Braille keyboards.  It has a great number of haptic touch features, which deliver data that you would usually only get visually.

In the resources for accessible design, there are a- there's a web page which links to a whole list of different resources.  I'm going to call out a few of them here that I think are important, and the first one is the `axe-core` accessibility testing library.  Now, this is very important for accessibility because it is entirely open-source, and it's what Google's accessibility checker and a lot of other similar things are built on.  The Color Oracle desktop filter is a very important one for colourblindness.  And the reason why I'm calling this tool out specifically is there are a bunch of browser extensions that you can get, but the Color Oracle desktop filter is the only one that will allow you to plug it into desktop applications as well.  So if you're developing a desktop application rather than a web application, that's a very useful tool.  If you want to test what you're doing with a screen reader, the Paciello Group, one of the very early accessibility consultancies, produced a list of basic screen reader commands for pretty much all of the common screen readers.  And you can just get those up on a computer and try them out yourself.  Additionally, the- researchers at the University of Maryland produced the Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool a few years ago.  And that one is really important, because photosensitive epilepsy is a disability that we can't ask people to test for.  If you're asking people to test for that and they have a seizure, that's potentially going to be threatening to their health, or in the worst case, threatening to their life.  So the researchers at the University of Maryland produced this tool, which basically allows you to check the contrast and animations on your website to ensure that they're not going to be a problem for people with photosensitive epilepsy.

Now, guidelines are great.  Guidelines are a really good starting point, but guidelines do not tell the whole story.  This really comes down to that often misused adage of the 80/20 principle.  And I'll sum it up like this: the vast majority of accessibility issues that you might run into can be very easily solved by looking at and understanding the guidelines.  But there are some accessibility issues that the guidelines don't cover, and there are situations where the guidelines are misleading.  In those sorts of scenarios, what you want to do is make sure that you have a clear and understandable path for people who have those issues to come to you, report them, and get them to the right people so that they are going to be actioned.

And with most accessibility talks, this is the point at which the person giving the talk would explain to you how to solve one particular problem, in one particular language, for one particular scenario.  This is not one of that talks.  And the reason for that is because I think it's often very instructive to look at the ways that people do this wrong - so that we can learn from them, and hopefully not repeat the mistakes.

This is Atlassian Confluence.  And my assumption is that the vast majority of the people in the audience here have used Atlassian Confluence before.  For those of you who haven't, it's basically a shared documentation wiki.  So you've got a test space here, you've got a bunch of data, you can click around it, you can go in and create pages, and when you click the button to create a page, you get something back that looks a bit like this.  And that- looks fine.  Right?  But we're going to go back and look at that again.  Because, despite the fact that this page was created in my test space, which you can see because my name is up there, I actually wasn't the person who created it.  It was created by someone called Matthew Gregory.  And at the time that I first gave this talk, Matt was my manager.  So why was it that Matt was the person who was creating this page, and not me?  Well, that would be your answer.  Because when I went into Confluence back in the day, and I tried to create pages, what I would get is that the button there would be cut off the bottom of the screen.  Which meant that I could not navigate to it.  Which meant that I could not create pages.

Oops.  So, you can actually scroll the options within the Confluence pop-up - and Atlassian have done a bit of work in fixing this since - but what this essentially meant at the time was that if you were using a magnified screen for particular configurations, because you couldn't scroll the whole screen to see the whole pop-up, you just wouldn't be able to create pages at all, or you would have to learn how to tab-navigate your way around blind - without screen reader cues - to be able to do it.  And that pretty much meant that that was a piece of work that I just offloaded onto my colleagues!  Every time I needed to create a page, I called someone over and I went 'hey, can you come do this for me please?'

So how do we improve it?  Well, you want to make sure that your UI elements are all scrollable, and that nothing is cut off by the bottom of the screen.  So you want to set it up so that- it's not just, you know, scrolling the options within the pop-up, that the whole page there is scrollable.  You want to make sure that you test your pop-up windows for accessibility.  So looking at things like, do they block out other elements of the user interface?  If someone is using a zoomed-in screen or a screen reader, can they actually navigate their way around this pop-up window, without losing focus, without things being cut off the bottom of the screen?  And the best way to deal with it is you zoom it up yourself, or you find a visually impaired person, you get them to test it for you.  And that will very quickly show you where a lot of those issues are going to be.

'I need a human screen reader!'  Now I was not the person who said this.  The person who said 'I need a human screen reader' was my friend's grandmother.  She is unfortunately now deceased.  She was a lovely person, and later on in life, due to a degenerative disease, she became blind.  Now she was quite religious, and she used the Patheos website, which billed itself as 'Hosting the Conversation on Faith', to keep in touch with her religious community when she was no longer able to easily go to church.  And when she started using Patheos, many, many years ago, it looked like this.  And visually that site is not too bad.  It was also not all that bad to navigate with a screen reader.  It wasn't perfect, but you could see where things were, you could relatively easily navigate your way around most of it, and it was fairly apparent what was going on where.  They also designed it in such a way that you didn't have auto-playing videos, and cluttered pop-ups which would come up and block your view of part of the page.  Until in late 2017, early 2018, Patheos went through a redesign.  And at the end of the redesign, their website looked like this.  And I can't show you the accessibility issues with their website, because some of the problems that they had were so bad that at the time I was originally putting this talk together, a lot of the major browsers released a feature that blocked a lot of these obnoxious pop-ups on site.  That- the beginning of that text there, 'Advertisement'?  I wasn't using an ad blocker when I did this, that was just blocked.  But back in the day, when my friend's grandmother was trying to use this website, what would happen was she would tab around and suddenly she would find herself in an ad pop-up.  Or there would be auto-playing videos that were talking over her screen reader, which meant that she couldn't hear the cues that she needed to navigate around the website.  And that made her feel something like this.  She was not happy, she was not very pleased, and she no longer used the Patheos website.

If you want an example of this closer to home, Coles - the big supermarket chain - got sued by a screen reader user because their website for online ordering was not accessible with a screen reader.  And Coles ended up settling that lawsuit, and one of the stipulations of the settlement was that Coles actually had to make sure that their online website was accessible to screen reader users.  So if you want to have a look at someone who does this really well, Coles is it, and that's because now they know they have to do it.
