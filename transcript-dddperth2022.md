# This Talk Has Been Disabled - DDD Perth 2022 - Transcript

HANNAH: Going to kick us off today is Dawn, Dawn E. Collett.  Dawn likes to tinker with cloud infrastructure and security, and regularly goes down rabbit holes in a futile search- a futile search for ways to develop systems that are both reliable and impenetrable.  As well as accidental accessibility advocacy, Dawn can regularly be found sharing knowledge within the Melbourne cloud infrastructure and DevOps communities.  Outside work, Dawn is an occasional author, a kitchen alchemist, and a raging sportsball fan.  Over to you, Dawn!

DAWN: Thank you!  Can everyone hear me; am I hooked up to the AV?  [pause]

So, I was supposed to come here today to talk to you about web accessibility.  But unfortunately, on my flight from Melbourne to Perth yesterday, my talk was disabled; so I'm going to spend approximately the next 45 minutes explaining to you how we go about re-enabling it.  If you want to follow along with the sources that I used when I was putting together this talk, you can scan that QR code up there, or go to the Github link.  That will take you to a Github repository which has all of the sources sorted by type.

To begin with, I want to acknowledge the fact that I am presenting today on Aboriginal land.  I want to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land here, the Whadjuk Nyungar people; and also the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation, on whose land this talk came into being.  This country is and always will be Aboriginal land.  Their sovereignty was never ceded.  I also want to tip my hat to- the old men and women, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mentors that I myself had growing up.  Because among many other incredibly valuable lessons that I learned from them, they taught me about the importance of stories, and I wouldn't be here giving this presentation to you today without them.

I also want to thank all of the sponsors who have made this possible.  It has been amazing to be able to come from Melbourne to Perth to do this, already to meet so many awesome people; and it would not be possible without all of the sponsors.

You've kind of got the introduction there.  That's me; my name is Dawn; my day job is I'm an engineer at Innablr - we are a tiny little consultancy in Melbourne, we love solving DevOps and cloudy type problems - that's what I do in my day job, if you want to know more about that you can ask me more.  But the reason that I'm here speaking to all of you today is because I am an accidental accessibility advocate.  We're going to get back to that one.  As Hannah said, outside work I am an occasional author and kitchen alchemist - sometimes that ends really well, sometimes it doesn't.  I am also a raging sportsball fan, hence that picture and this being me in Boston Bruins clothing.  That's a hockey team, for the record.

So, the accidental accessibility advocate bit.  The last two words of that are very easy to understand.  The accidental is a bit less so.  And in order to explain that, I need to take you on a little bit of a tour.  And we are going to start that tour in the UK, with this excellent disabled toilet which is down a set of stairs.  I don't know if any of you have ever tried to take a wheelchair down a set of stairs; do not recommend.  Over in New Zealand, much closer to home, we do actually have a ramp to be able to get into this building, but unfortunately for the poor powerchair user who's currently sitting and staring at it, it is blocked off by a couple of large orange traffic cones.  Again - if you want to get into the building, not absolutely conducive to that.

And finally, the place where I conceived this talk, and the place where I live - in Melbourne - we have these EXELOOs around the place.  Erm, space age public toilets, if you will.  And the reason why these made it into a talk about accidental accessibility advocacy, is because they have a cleaning cycle which runs.  And that is indicated by a large light which will go on in the cubicle of the toilet.  There is also a panel in the toilet which explains that when the large light goes on, you should vacate, because it's about to start its cleaning cycle.  That panel is translated into Braille.  Braille.  Blind people.  Light.  Doesn't quite compute there.

So before I get on, let's define a few important terms.  To begin with: disability, by the Australian definition, is a continuing condition which restricts everyday activities.  A continuing condition means that it's likely to last for six months or more; the restricting everyday activities bit is fairly self-explanatory.  Then there's accessibility, and that's the degree to which an activity can be done by everyone.  Now, this is not just about disability.  One s- case study that I like to use here is from about December 2009, if anyone remembers HP's racist webcam, where a black gentleman had gone out and bought himself a state-of-the-art HP laptop which had a wonderful web camera which was supposed to be able to do facial recognition.  Except it couldn't.  Until he got his white co-worker to test it.

And then there's adaptive technology.  And those are tools that disabled people to- use to improve access.  That can be exceptionally low-tech.  This - my walking stick - is a piece of adaptive technology.  Wheelchairs are adaptive technology.  Some things that we use in architecture, like ramps, can be part of adaptive technology.  But in the broader sense, in terms of technical pieces of adaptive technology, we're talking here about things like screen readers; things like adaptive and augmentative communication; things which are essentially attached to a computer.

And - warning - this is where we get political for a minute.  Excuse me- as I get back to the right slide.  There are, broadly, two different ways that we can define disability: the medical model and the social model.  The medical model of disability holds that disability itself is a problem; that disability is something that we should try to resolve, something that we should try to cure.  And that is illustrated here by this clipart blob in a wheelchair being comforted by a vaguely doctor-looking clipart blob.  On the other hand the social model holds that it's not so much disability that's the problem, it's accessibility; that we shouldn't be trying to change people, we should be trying to change the world around them to make it easier to navigate.  And when that goes well, that's illustrated by things like adaptive sports that we have over here.  You know, these people who are playing sports in wheelchairs look perfectly happy doing it.  And I wouldn't want to dismiss the medical model entirely because there are some great interventions that have come out of that.  But for the purposes of the work that we're doing, the way that I would suggest that we look at this is through the lens of the social model.  We want to try to modify the environment to make it easier for people to use.

And, if you're here, I feel pretty confident in saying that this is part of your job!  So to illustrate that, let's look at a few case studies of how this goes well and how this goes badly.  This is `arngren.net`, and I didn't have to look very hard to find this; it's on a great many list of top 10 worst websites ever.  And it's visually very cluttered.  You can see that - I mean it would probably make more sense to me if I spoke Norwegian - but you've got a bunch of pictures here which are all very confused, you've got a bunch of colours, there's not really a whole lot of structure to it.  And it would not surprise you that if you try to navigate `arngren.net` with a screen reader, you're going to have a great deal of difficulty doing it.  Because that structure that's replicated- that structure that we see here visually is replicated in the lack of structure that you get when trying to navigate it with a screen reader.  There's a hell of a lot of red and green here, and that's really difficult for colourblind people.  Unsurprisingly, many of the images here don't actually have alt text, and it's also not clear which images are tied to which links because of the lack of structure.

And then there's distinctive design.  This is Ling's Cars, and you may or may not believe this, but this is actually one of the most successful Car leasing businesses in the United Kingdom.  And it is built around the brand of Ling Valentine, the owner.  And the brand is obvious.  Ling's face is animated.  The, ah, tongue with the British flag on it is animated.  The traffic lights are animated.  And my favourite bit, which I couldn't get into this screenshot from when I originally took it, was the GIF of Boris Johnson shrugging used to illustrate the Boris Brexit Guarantee: that if the UK left the EU, the cost of leasing your car would not go up.

But if you want to build a distinctive website like this, there are a lot of considerations that go into it.  You have to think about things like - that text across the top, that's not text, that's actually clipart.  So it's not necessarily going to be immediately apparent that that's the launching point of your page, and you also need to then add alt text to it.  You can have issues with backgrounds making it difficult for people to navigate things.  You know, there is a lot of alt text that has gone into this website, but when I originally looked at it, there wasn't a lot of it there.  There were a lot of scenarios where pictures were used to illustrate things without something that would be backed up by a screen reader.  And if you have photos- photosensitivity problems, you are not going to have fun trying to navigate the site.

Then there's an example of good design.  And this is one that probably a lot of us use every day, and that is Github.  Github does a few things really well that are not necessarily intuitive.  To start with, if you look at that top bar over there, you can see that you've got the Github logo; the search bar; but then next to it, you've actually got `Pull Requests`, `Issues`, `Marketplace`, `Explore`.  And those are easy anchors for screen reader users to be able to get to the areas of Github that they might frequently use.  Github is very, very good about not just conveying information with colour.  The layout is quite easy to understand visually.  It scales very well.  And this is actually a screenshot of the NVDA repo - the free and open-source screen reader for Windows.  And the people who developed NVDA migrated it over to Github because they found that for their users - the vast majority of whom are screen reader users - GitHub was a very easy way for them to submit bugs.
